# Cleaning-and-Exploratory-Analysis-of-Global-Layoff-Data
This project aims to perform data cleaning and exploratory analysis on global layoff dataset. The global layoff dataset consists of data of the employees laid off by various companies across the globe during a period of 4 years from 2020 to 2023.

Part I - Data Cleaning
In the first stage of this project, the data is imported from an Excel CSV file in to MySQL. In the staging part, I created a temporary table to avoid performing queries on the original data. Then, identified the data inconsistencies and fixed them with use of SQL queries.

Part II - Exploratory Analysis of the Cleaned Data
In the second stage, the cleaned data is analysed to identify trends and patterns in the layoffs in the companies during these 4 years.
